#Python
#Logical Operator    

a = 10
b = 5

print (a > b and a < b)           # 1st condition is true and 2nd condition is false,so it return false 
                                  #Returns True if both statements are true


print (a > b or a < b)            # Returns True if one of the statements is true

print ((not a > b and a < b)) 	  # Reverse the result, returns False if the not(x < 5 and x < 10) result is true
